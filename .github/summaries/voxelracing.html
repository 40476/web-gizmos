  <p>Infinity Racer is a browser-based 3D racing game built with Three.js and MQTT networking. It features procedurally generated terrain, real-time multiplayer racing, and a full audio soundboard system. Players can customize their vehicles, chat with others, and race across dynamically generated landscapes with day/night cycles and physics-based vehicle handling.</p>
