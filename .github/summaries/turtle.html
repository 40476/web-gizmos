    <li>A turtle ecosystem simulation where turtles exhibit behaviors like seeking food, wandering, and interacting with environment elements.</li>
    <li>Grid-based terrain system with configurable cell types including walls, water, grass and sand, editable via painting interface.</li>
    <li>Customizable settings panel for adjusting turtle personalities, population density, speed parameters, and visual effects.</li>

  <p>This interactive turtle ecosystem allows users to create and modify environments using a grid-based terrain editor. Turtles autonomously navigate while pursuing food based on personality-driven behaviors like caution or aggression. The simulation includes features like lilypads for resting turtles, obstacle avoidance, and real-time performance statistics tracking.</p>
