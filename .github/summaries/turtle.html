  <p>A web-based turtle ecosystem simulator where procedural-generated turtles interact with dynamically placed food and obstacles. Users can customize turtle behaviors through personality settings while editing environments with terrain brushes and lily pads. The simulation includes collision detection, pathfinding algorithms, and real-time statistics tracking for observing emergent behaviors.</p>
